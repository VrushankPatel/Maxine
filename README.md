## Introduction

Maxine is a Service registry and a discovery server that detects and registers each service and device in the network and works as a true reverse proxy to make each service available by its name. Maxine SRD solves the problem of hardwiring URLs to establish flawless communication between microservices.

Maxine SRD has the ability to locate a network automatically making it so that there is no need for a long configuration setup process. The Service discovery works by services connecting through REST on the network allowing devices or services to connect without any manual intervention.

## How Maxine works

1. Assuming that the Maxine SRD server is up and running and all the services or microservices in the network have MAXINE-CLIENT added as a dependency in it, below are the steps on how Service discovery will work.
2. The Maxine client installed in all the services will start sending the heartbeat (A special request that'll have all the necessary metadata of that service to let the other services connect) to the Maxine SRD.
3. The SRD server will extract the service metadata from that request payload and will save it in the in-memory database (to reduce the latency), The server will also run a thread that'll remove that service metadata after the given timeout in the metadata (If not provided, then default heartbeat timeout will be used). SRD will store the data by keeping the serviceName as the primary key so that by the serviceName, its URL can be discovered.
4. After this, all the services that want to intercommunicate with the service inside its network, It'll connect to that service via the Maxine client, and here, it'll use the serviceName instead of the service URL, and the Maxine API client will pass that request to SRD.
5. SRD will receive the request and will extract the serviceName from it. It'll discover if that service is stored there in the registry, If it is, then it'll proxy the request to that service's URL.
6. If that service name has multiple nodes in the registry, then SRD will distribute the traffic across all the nodes of that service.

Below is a tiny animation that explains how maxine registers all the services in the network by their HEARTBEATs sent by the maxine client.

<br/><br/>
Notice that the service 3 doesn't have maxine-client installed so it is not sending the heartbeat and therefore, it can not be registered in the maxine registry.
However, that's not the end of it, the explicit custom client can be developed (based on the API Documentation) to communicate with maxine server.
Once the services are registered, Below is the animation that shows how services intercommunicate by maxine client and via maxine's service discovery.

<br/><br/>
As we can see, maxine SRD is working as a true reverse proxy for each servers, and proxying all the requests to the respective servers by searching for their URLs in registry by using the serviceName as a key.


## What problems does Maxine solve?

* When working with SOA (Service oriented architecture) or microservices, we usually have to establish the inter-service communication by their URL that gets constituted by SSL check, Hostname, port, and path.
* The host and port are not something that'll be the same every time. Based on the availability of ports, we have to achieve a flexible architecture so, we can choose the ports randomly but what about the service communication, how'd the other services know that some service's address is changed?
* That's the issue that Maxine solves. No matter where (on which port) the service is running, as long as the MAXINE-CLIENT is added to it, it'll always be discoverable to the SRD. This centralized service store and retrieval architecture make inter-service communication more reliable and robust.
* Also, based on the service's performance diagnostics (If it's down or not working properly), we can stop its registration to the SRD. The client provides functions that can stop sending the heartbeat to the SRD so that the service can be deregistered.
* Also, If any of the services are hosted on more powerful hardware, then we can make SRD distribute more traffic on that service's nodes than the others. All we have to do is to provide weight property to that service's client. the weight means how much power that service has comparedÂ to others. Based on weight property, the SRD will register that service will replications, and traffic will be distributed accordingly.
* Maxine now includes health check capabilities to monitor service availability and persistence to survive restarts.
* Maxine is optimized for high performance with in-memory caching (configurable TTL), debounced file saves, parallel health checks, connection pooling, circuit breaker for unhealthy nodes, and efficient load balancing algorithms including Round Robin, Consistent Hashing, Rendezvous Hashing, Least Connections, and Random.
* Security is enhanced with JWT authentication for all registry operations.
* Comprehensive metrics collection provides insights into request counts, latencies, and error rates.

## New Features

* **Performance Optimizations**: In-memory caching for discovery operations with configurable TTL (60s), debounced asynchronous file saves for persistence, parallel health checks, aggressive connection pooling for proxying (500 max sockets), and API rate limiting.
* **Circuit Breaker**: Automatically skips unhealthy service nodes during discovery with failure counting and automatic recovery to improve reliability.
* **Background Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks every 30 seconds to maintain up-to-date service status without impacting request latency.
* **Optimized Discovery**: Healthy nodes cache eliminates filtering overhead on each discovery request, ensuring lightning-fast service lookups.
* **Load Balancing Strategies**: Supports Round Robin (RR), Consistent Hashing (CH), Rendezvous Hashing (RH), Least Connections (LC), and Random selection with health-aware routing.
* **Security**: JWT-based authentication for registry operations (register, deregister, discover, health, metrics).
* **Metrics**: Real-time metrics endpoint at `/api/maxine/serviceops/metrics` providing request counts, latencies, and error statistics.
* **Health Checks**: Enhanced parallel health monitoring for service nodes with automatic status updates and persistence across restarts.

## Setup for development

### Starting the development server

1. Clone the project in your local dir.
2. Install all the dependencies by `npm i`.
3. Start dev server by `npm run dev` (nodemon).

### Test the maxine and generate the coverage.

1. run `npm test` to run all the tests.
2. To generate the reports, there is a task called genreports, try `npm run genreports` to generate reports.
3. To upload the coverage report to codecov.io, the codecov token is required, set the parameter `>>> CODECOV_TOKEN = {token}` in environment and run `npm run coverage` to upload the coverage to codecov.

### Run maxine on production.

1. Run command `npm start` to start the application with all the pretests.
