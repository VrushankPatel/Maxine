## Introduction

Maxine is a Service registry and discovery server that detects and registers each service and device in the network, providing service addresses for client-side discovery to enable fast communication between microservices. It includes optional reverse proxy capabilities for scenarios requiring centralized routing. Maxine SRD solves the problem of hardwiring URLs to establish flawless communication between microservices.

Maxine SRD has the ability to locate a network automatically making it so that there is no need for a long configuration setup process. The Service discovery works by services connecting through REST on the network allowing devices or services to connect without any manual intervention.

## How Maxine works

1. Assuming that the Maxine SRD server is up and running and all the services or microservices in the network have MAXINE-CLIENT added as a dependency in it, below are the steps on how Service discovery will work.
2. The Maxine client installed in all the services will start sending the heartbeat (A special request that'll have all the necessary metadata of that service to let the other services connect) to the Maxine SRD.
3. The SRD server will extract the service metadata from that request payload and will save it in the in-memory database (to reduce the latency), The server will also run a thread that'll remove that service metadata after the given timeout in the metadata (If not provided, then default heartbeat timeout will be used). SRD will store the data by keeping the serviceName as the primary key so that by the serviceName, its URL can be discovered.
4. After this, all the services that want to intercommunicate with the service inside its network, They'll connect to that service via the Maxine client, using the serviceName instead of the service URL. The Maxine API client will query SRD for the service address.
5. SRD will receive the request and will extract the serviceName from it. It'll discover if that service is stored there in the registry, If it is, then it'll return the service's address to the client for direct connection. Optionally, if proxy mode is enabled (proxy=true), it can proxy the request to the service.
6. If that service name has multiple nodes in the registry, then SRD will select a node based on the load balancing strategy and return its address.

Below is a tiny animation that explains how maxine registers all the services in the network by their HEARTBEATs sent by the maxine client.
<br/><br/>
<img src="docs/img/anim/maxine-registry.gif" />
<br/><br/>
Notice that the service 3 doesn't have maxine-client installed so it is not sending the heartbeat and therefore, it can not be registered in the maxine registry.
However, that's not the end of it, the explicit custom client can be developed (based on the API Documentation) to communicate with maxine server.
Once the services are registered, Below is the animation that shows how services intercommunicate by maxine client and via maxine's service discovery.
<br/><br/>
<img src="docs/img/anim/maxine-discovery.gif" />
<br/><br/>
As we can see, maxine SRD provides service addresses for direct client connections, enabling fast and efficient inter-service communication. When proxy mode is used, it acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate servers.


## What problems does Maxine solve?

* When working with SOA (Service oriented architecture) or microservices, we usually have to establish the inter-service communication by their URL that gets constituted by SSL check, Hostname, port, and path.
* The host and port are not something that'll be the same every time. Based on the availability of ports, we have to achieve a flexible architecture so, we can choose the ports randomly but what about the service communication, how'd the other services know that some service's address is changed?
* That's the issue that Maxine solves. No matter where (on which port) the service is running, as long as the MAXINE-CLIENT is added to it, it'll always be discoverable to the SRD. This centralized service store and retrieval architecture make inter-service communication more reliable and robust.
* Also, based on the service's performance diagnostics (If it's down or not working properly), we can stop its registration to the SRD. The client provides functions that can stop sending the heartbeat to the SRD so that the service can be deregistered.
* Also, If any of the services are hosted on more powerful hardware, then we can make SRD distribute more traffic on that service's nodes than the others. All we have to do is to provide weight property to that service's client. the weight means how much power that service has comparedÂ to others. Based on weight property, the SRD will register that service will replications, and traffic will be distributed accordingly.
 * Maxine now includes health check capabilities to monitor service availability and persistence to survive restarts.
  * Maxine is optimized for high performance with in-memory LRU caching (1M entries, 1-hour TTL), debounced file saves, parallel health checks (every 60 seconds with 50 concurrency), connection pooling, circuit breaker for unhealthy nodes, and efficient load balancing algorithms including Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, Least Response Time, Consistent Hashing, Rendezvous Hashing, Least Connections, Least Loaded, and Random. High performance mode disables response time tracking and connection counting for maximum throughput. Health checks disabled by default for maximum performance; enable with HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true for automatic service health monitoring.
 * Security is enhanced with JWT authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for all registry operations.
* Comprehensive metrics collection provides insights into request counts, latencies, and error rates.
* Clustering support for multi-core CPU utilization.
* Configuration via environment variables for flexible deployment.
