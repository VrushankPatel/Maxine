Assistant: Now, create the core registry.ts file. From the summary: "Built a complete service registry in AssemblyScript/TypeScript (src/wasm/registry.ts) with core functionality: service registration, discovery, heartbeats, deregistration, and cleanup. Used proper WebAssembly types (f64 for timestamps, proper casting for Date.now())."

I need to implement a service registry in TypeScript that can be compiled to WebAssembly.

Key features: register, discover, heartbeat, deregister, cleanup.

Since it's WebAssembly, it needs to be efficient, use proper types.

I'll use Maps or arrays for storage.

For timestamps, use f64 (double) for time.

Date.now() returns f64 in JS, but in AS, we can use performance.now() or something, but since it's WASM, perhaps simulate.

AssemblyScript has Date class, but for WASM, better to use f64.

Let me sketch the code. 

First, define interfaces or classes for Service, Instance.

Then a Registry class with methods. 

Since AS exports need to be functions, perhaps export functions that operate on a global registry.

But for simplicity, a class with static methods or something.

AS can export classes, but the summary says "warnings about classes not being exported (expected for WASM modules)."

So probably export functions.

Let me write the code. 

First, define types.

export class ServiceInstance {

  id: string;

  address: string;

  port: i32;

  lastHeartbeat: f64;

  metadata: Map<string, string>;

}

But AS has limitations, Map is available.

For simplicity, use arrays.

Let me write. 

Actually, since it's WASM, keep it simple. Use arrays of structs.

Define a struct for instance.

In AS, use class or struct.

Let me write the file. 

First, the registry.ts

// Service registry for WebAssembly

export class ServiceInstance {

  id: string;

  address: string;

  port: i32;

  lastHeartbeat: f64;

  metadata: Map<string, string>;

  constructor(id: string, address: string, port: i32, metadata: Map<string, string>) {

    this.id = id;

    this.address = address;

    this.port = port;

    this.lastHeartbeat = Date.now();

    this.metadata = metadata;

  }

}

export class ServiceRegistry {

  private static services: Map<string, ServiceInstance[]> = new Map();

  static register(serviceName: string, instanceId: string, address: string, port: i32, metadata: Map<string, string>): boolean {

    if (!this.services.has(serviceName)) {

      this.services.set(serviceName, []);

    }

    const instances = this.services.get(serviceName);

    // Check if instance already exists

    for (let i = 0; i < instances.length; i++) {

      if (instances[i].id == instanceId) {

        return false; // already registered

      }

    }

    const instance = new ServiceInstance(instanceId, address, port, metadata);

    instances.push(instance);

    return true;

  }

  static discover(serviceName: string): ServiceInstance[] {

    return this.services.has(serviceName) ? this.services.get(serviceName) : [];

  }

  static heartbeat(serviceName: string, instanceId: string): boolean {

    if (!this.services.has(serviceName)) return false;

    const instances = this.services.get(serviceName);

    for (let i = 0; i < instances.length; i++) {

      if (instances[i].id == instanceId) {

        instances[i].lastHeartbeat = Date.now();

        return true;

      }

    }

    return false;

  }

  static deregister(serviceName: string, instanceId: string): boolean {

    if (!this.services.has(serviceName)) return false;

    const instances = this.services.get(serviceName);

    for (let i = 0; i < instances.length; i++) {

      if (instances[i].id == instanceId) {

        instances.splice(i, 1);

        return true;

      }

    }

    return false;

  }

  static cleanup(timeoutMs: f64): void {

    const now = Date.now();

    for (let serviceName of this.services.keys()) {

      const instances = this.services.get(serviceName);

      for (let i = instances.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

        if (now - instances[i].lastHeartbeat > timeoutMs) {

          instances.splice(i, 1);

        }

      }

      if (instances.length == 0) {

        this.services.delete(serviceName);

      }

    }

  }

  static getServiceCount(): i32 {

    return this.services.size;

  }

  static getInstanceCount(serviceName: string): i32 {

    return this.services.has(serviceName) ? this.services.get(serviceName).length : 0;

  }

}

But AS Date.now() might not be available, need to check.

In AS, Date is available, but for WASM, perhaps use a parameter.

To make it work, perhaps export functions that take time as parameter.

But for simplicity, assume Date.now() works.

Now, create index.ts as entry point. 

From summary: src/wasm/index.ts

Probably just export the class or functions.

Since class not exported, perhaps export functions.

Let me adjust.

In AS, to export to WASM, need to export functions.

So, perhaps make the registry global.

Let me rewrite. 

Create a global registry.

const registry = new Map<string, ServiceInstance[]>();

export function register(serviceName: string, instanceId: string, address: string, port: i32): boolean {

  if (!registry.has(serviceName)) {

    registry.set(serviceName, []);

  }

  const instances = registry.get(serviceName);

  for (let i = 0; i < instances.length; i++) {

    if (instances[i].id == instanceId) {

      return false;

    }

  }

  const instance = new ServiceInstance(instanceId, address, port, new Map());

  instances.push(instance);

  return true;

}

// Similarly for others.

For metadata, perhaps simplify, no metadata for now.

For discover, how to return array? In WASM, tricky.

Perhaps return a pointer or something, but for simplicity, perhaps use strings or something.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps the summary has it as class, and warnings are ok.

Let me keep the class and see.

For the index.ts, perhaps:

export * from "./registry";

Now, create the JS loader: src/wasm/wasm-registry.js

It should instantiate the WASM module and provide JS API.

Use WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming or something.

Since it's ESM bindings, perhaps import.

The build script is "asc src/wasm/index.ts --target release"

With asconfig, it should generate build/registry.wasm

Then in JS, load it.

Let me write the JS file.

const fs = require('fs');

const path = require('path');

async function loadWasmRegistry() {

  const wasmPath = path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'registry.wasm');

  const wasmBuffer = fs.readFileSync(wasmPath);

  const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBuffer, {});

  return wasmModule.instance.exports;

}

module.exports = { loadWasmRegistry };

But since it's ESM bindings, perhaps different.

AssemblyScript with "bindings": "esm" generates JS file as well.

The asc command with --target release will generate .wasm and .js if bindings esm.

But in asconfig, "bindings": "esm", so it should generate a .js file that exports the functions.

So, the JS loader can just require that.

But since it's WASM, the .js is the loader.

Perhaps the build generates registry.js that exports the WASM functions.

So, in wasm-registry.js, just require('./build/registry');

Then provide API.

For testing, src/wasm/test-wasm.js

Run the functions.

First, let's create the files.

Let me start with registry.ts

I'll simplify, no metadata, and for discover, perhaps return a string or something, but for now, assume we can return arrays.

In AS, arrays can be returned, but in WASM, it's pointers.

For simplicity, let's implement and see.

Perhaps use a simple registry with strings.

Let me write. 

registry.ts:

// WebAssembly Service Registry

// Simple registry using maps

let services: Map<string, string[]> = new Map(); // serviceName -> instanceIds

let instances: Map<string, string> = new Map(); // instanceId -> address:port

let heartbeats: Map<string, f64> = new Map(); // instanceId -> lastHeartbeat

export function register(serviceName: string, instanceId: string, address: string, port: i32): boolean {

  if (heartbeats.has(instanceId)) {

    return false; // already registered

  }

  if (!services.has(serviceName)) {

    services.set(serviceName, []);

  }

  services.get(serviceName).push(instanceId);

  instances.set(instanceId, address + ":" + port.toString());

  heartbeats.set(instanceId, Date.now());

  return true;

}

export function discover(serviceName: string): string {

  if (!services.has(serviceName)) {

    return "";

  }

  const ids = services.get(serviceName);

  let result = "";

  for (let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {

    if (i > 0) result += ",";

    result += instances.get(ids[i]);

  }

  return result;

}

export function heartbeat(instanceId: string): boolean {

  if (!heartbeats.has(instanceId)) {

    return false;

  }

  heartbeats.set(instanceId, Date.now());

  return true;

}

export function deregister(serviceName: string, instanceId: string): boolean {

  if (!services.has(serviceName) || !heartbeats.has(instanceId)) {

    return false;

  }

  const ids = services.get(serviceName);

  const index = ids.indexOf(instanceId);

  if (index == -1) return false;

  ids.splice(index, 1);

  instances.delete(instanceId);

  heartbeats.delete(instanceId);

  return true;

}

export function cleanup(timeoutMs: f64): void {

  const now = Date.now();

  const toRemove: string[] = [];

  for (let id of heartbeats.keys()) {

    if (now - heartbeats.get(id) > timeoutMs) {

      toRemove.push(id);

    }

  }

  for (let id of toRemove) {

    // find service

    for (let service of services.keys()) {

      const ids = services.get(service);

      const index = ids.indexOf(id);

      if (index != -1) {

        ids.splice(index, 1);

        break;

      }

    }

    instances.delete(id);

    heartbeats.delete(id);

  }

}

export function getServiceCount(): i32 {

  return services.size;

}

export function getInstanceCount(serviceName: string): i32 {

  return services.has(serviceName) ? services.get(serviceName).length : 0;

}

This should work, discover returns a comma-separated string of addresses.

Now, index.ts:

export * from "./registry";

Now, the JS loader: wasm-registry.js

Since bindings esm, the asc will generate registry.js that exports the functions.

So, const { register, discover, heartbeat, deregister, cleanup, getServiceCount, getInstanceCount } = require('./build/registry');

Then, provide a class or object with methods.

class WasmRegistry {

  register(serviceName, instanceId, address, port) {

    return register(serviceName, instanceId, address, port);

  }

  discover(serviceName) {

    const str = discover(serviceName);

    return str ? str.split(',') : [];

  }

  heartbeat(instanceId) {

    return heartbeat(instanceId);

  }

  deregister(serviceName, instanceId) {

    return deregister(serviceName, instanceId);

  }

  cleanup(timeoutMs) {

    cleanup(timeoutMs);

  }

  getServiceCount() {

    return getServiceCount();

  }

  getInstanceCount(serviceName) {

    return getInstanceCount(serviceName);

  }

}

module.exports = WasmRegistry;

For test: test-wasm.js

const WasmRegistry = require('./wasm-registry');

const registry = new WasmRegistry();

console.log('Testing WASM Registry');

// Register

console.log('Register service1 instance1: ', registry.register('service1', 'instance1', 'localhost', 8080));

console.log('Register service1 instance2: ', registry.register('service1', 'instance2', 'localhost', 8081));

console.log('Register service2 instance3: ', registry.register('service2', 'instance3', 'localhost', 8082));

// Discover

console.log('Discover service1: ', registry.discover('service1'));

console.log('Discover service2: ', registry.discover('service2'));

// Heartbeat

console.log('Heartbeat instance1: ', registry.heartbeat('instance1'));

// Deregister

console.log('Deregister service1 instance1: ', registry.deregister('service1', 'instance1'));

console.log('Discover service1 after deregister: ', registry.discover('service1'));

// Counts

console.log('Service count: ', registry.getServiceCount());

console.log('Instance count service1: ', registry.getInstanceCount('service1'));

console.log('Instance count service2: ', registry.getInstanceCount('service2'));

Now, to build, run npm run build-wasm

But first, create the files. 

First, registry.ts

Let me write it. 

In AS, Date.now() is available as global function.

Yes.

Also, Map and Array are available.

splice is on Array.

Yes.

Let me create the files. 

First, registry.ts

I need to use write tool. 

Since multiple files, I can batch the tool calls. 

Yes, use multiple write calls in one response. 

So, let's do that. 

First, registry.ts

Then index.ts

Then wasm-registry.js

Then test-wasm.js

Then run the build. 

The build script is "asc src/wasm/index.ts --target release"

With asconfig, it should use the config.

Yes. 

Then, to test, run node src/wasm/test-wasm.js

But first, need to build. 

Also, the output is build/registry.wasm, so need to create build dir? No, asc should create it.

Yes. 

Let's create the files. 

Since the summary says successfully compiled, but files not there, perhaps the build failed because Date.now() not available in AS.

In AssemblyScript, Date.now() is not a global, it's in the Date class, but for WASM, it's tricky.

AssemblyScript has a built-in Date class, but for time, it's better to use performance.now() or pass time.

To make it work, perhaps add a function to set time or something.

For simplicity, let's use a global variable for current time, and export a function to set it.

But for testing, we can set it.

Perhaps use a simple counter for time.

To make it work, let's modify.

Add a global let currentTime: f64 = 0;

export function setCurrentTime(time: f64): void {

  currentTime = time;

}

Then, use currentTime instead of Date.now().

In JS, before calling, setCurrentTime(Date.now())

Yes, that works.

So, update the code. 

In register: heartbeats.set(instanceId, currentTime);

In heartbeat: heartbeats.set(instanceId, currentTime);

In cleanup: if (currentTime - heartbeats.get(id) > timeoutMs)

Yes.

Now, in JS loader, add setCurrentTime.

In test, before operations, registry.setCurrentTime(Date.now());

But since it's WASM, the functions are exported.

In the class, add setCurrentTime(time) { setCurrentTime(time); }

Yes.

Now, let's write the files. 

First, registry.ts

// WebAssembly Service Registry

let currentTime: f64 = 0;

export function setCurrentTime(time: f64): void {

  currentTime = time;

}

let services: Map<string, string[]> = new Map();

let instances: Map<string, string> = new Map();

let heartbeats: Map<string, f64> = new Map();

export function register(serviceName: string, instanceId: string, address: string, port: i32): boolean {

  if (heartbeats.has(instanceId)) {

    return false;

  }

  if (!services.has(serviceName)) {

    services.set(serviceName, []);

  }

  services.get(serviceName).push(instanceId);

  instances.set(instanceId, address + ":" + port.toString());

  heartbeats.set(instanceId, currentTime);

  return true;

}

export function discover(serviceName: string): string {

  if (!services.has(serviceName)) {

    return "";

  }

  const ids = services.get(serviceName);

  let result = "";

  for (let i = 0, len = ids.length; i < len; i++) {

    if (i > 0) result += ",";

    result += instances.get(ids[i]);

  }

  return result;

}

export function heartbeat(instanceId: string): boolean {

  if (!heartbeats.has(instanceId)) {

    return false;

  }

  heartbeats.set(instanceId, currentTime);

  return true;

}

export function deregister(serviceName: string, instanceId: string): boolean {

  if (!services.has(serviceName) || !heartbeats.has(instanceId)) {

    return false;

  }

  const ids = services.get(serviceName);

  const index = ids.indexOf(instanceId);

  if (index == -1) return false;

  ids.splice(index, 1);

  instances.delete(instanceId);

  heartbeats.delete(instanceId);

  return true;

}

export function cleanup(timeoutMs: f64): void {

  const toRemove: string[] = [];

  for (let id of heartbeats.keys()) {

    if (currentTime - heartbeats.get(id) > timeoutMs) {

      toRemove.push(id);

    }

  }

  for (let id of toRemove) {

    for (let service of services.keys()) {

      const ids = services.get(service);

      const index = ids.indexOf(id);

      if (index != -1) {

        ids.splice(index, 1);

        if (ids.length == 0) {

          services.delete(service);

        }

        break;

      }

    }

    instances.delete(id);

    heartbeats.delete(id);

  }

}

export function getServiceCount(): i32 {

  return services.size;

}

export function getInstanceCount(serviceName: string): i32 {

  return services.has(serviceName) ? services.get(serviceName).length : 0;

}

Yes, this should work.

Now, index.ts

export * from "./registry";

Now, wasm-registry.js

const path = require('path');

const { register, discover, heartbeat, deregister, cleanup, getServiceCount, getInstanceCount, setCurrentTime } = require(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'registry'));

class WasmRegistry {

  setCurrentTime(time) {

    setCurrentTime(time);

  }

  register(serviceName, instanceId, address, port) {

    return register(serviceName, instanceId, address, port);

  }

  discover(serviceName) {

    const str = discover(serviceName);

    return str ? str.split(',') : [];

  }

  heartbeat(instanceId) {

    return heartbeat(instanceId);

  }

  deregister(serviceName, instanceId) {

    return deregister(serviceName, instanceId);

  }

  cleanup(timeoutMs) {

    cleanup(timeoutMs);

  }

  getServiceCount() {

    return getServiceCount();

  }

  getInstanceCount(serviceName) {

    return getInstanceCount(serviceName);

  }

}

module.exports = WasmRegistry;

Now, test-wasm.js

const WasmRegistry = require('./wasm-registry');

const registry = new WasmRegistry();

console.log('Testing WASM Registry');

registry.setCurrentTime(Date.now());

// Register

console.log('Register service1 instance1: ', registry.register('service1', 'instance1', 'localhost', 8080));

console.log('Register service1 instance2: ', registry.register('service1', 'instance2', 'localhost', 8081));

console.log('Register service2 instance3: ', registry.register('service2', 'instance3', 'localhost', 8082));

// Discover

console.log('Discover service1: ', registry.discover('service1'));

console.log('Discover service2: ', registry.discover('service2'));

// Heartbeat

console.log('Heartbeat instance1: ', registry.heartbeat('instance1'));

// Deregister

console.log('Deregister service1 instance1: ', registry.deregister('service1', 'instance1'));

console.log('Discover service1 after deregister: ', registry.discover('service1'));

// Counts

console.log('Service count: ', registry.getServiceCount());

console.log('Instance count service1: ', registry.getInstanceCount('service1'));

console.log('Instance count service2: ', registry.getInstanceCount('service2'));

// Test cleanup

registry.setCurrentTime(Date.now() + 60000); // advance time

registry.cleanup(30000); // timeout 30s

console.log('After cleanup, service count: ', registry.getServiceCount());

console.log('After cleanup, instance count service1: ', registry.getInstanceCount('service1'));

console.log('After cleanup, instance count service2: ', registry.getInstanceCount('service2'));

Now, to create these files, use write tool for each.

Since multiple, I can do multiple function calls in one response.

Yes. 

First, write registry.ts

Then index.ts

Then wasm-registry.js

Then test-wasm.js

Then run the build. 

The build is npm run build-wasm, which is asc src/wasm/index.ts --target release

With asconfig, it should output to src/wasm/build/registry.wasm and registry.js

Yes.

Then run the test. 

If it works, then the location is correct.

The summary said "The build output isn't in the expected `src/wasm/build/registry.wasm` location"

But with asconfig, it is.

Perhaps without asconfig, asc puts in build/ from cwd.

But with asconfig, it should be relative to the config file.

The extends is "../../node_modules/assemblyscript/std/assembly.json", so relative to src/wasm/

outFile: "build/registry.wasm", so src/wasm/build/registry.wasm

Yes.

Now, let's create the files. 

I will use multiple write calls. 

Since the response can have multiple tool calls. 

Yes. 

Let's do it. 

First, create the directory, already did.

Now, write the files. 

Start with registry.ts

The content is as above. 

Yes. 

Then index.ts: export * from "./registry";

Then wasm-registry.js as above.

Then test-wasm.js as above.

Then, run the build. 

To run build, use bash npm run build-wasm

Then, run the test. 

If it works, great.

If not, fix.

Also, perhaps need to install asc or something, but assemblyscript is installed, asc is the cli.

Yes.

Let's proceed. 

Since the summary says successfully compiled, but perhaps the files were not saved or something.

Anyway, let's create them. 

To batch, I can have multiple <xai:function_call> in the response. 

Yes. 

The format is multiple tags. 

Yes. 

So, let's write the response with multiple write calls. 

First for registry.ts

Then index.ts

Then wasm-registry.js

Then test-wasm.js

Then bash for build

Then bash for test

But test after build.

Yes. 

Since build may take time, but in parallel? No, build first.

But since tool calls are sequential? No, they are executed in order.

But to be safe, do build first, then test.

But since I can have multiple, but for dependency, better to do build, then test.

But in one response, I can do build, then test.

Yes. 

Let's do that. 

First, the writes, then build, then test. 

Yes. 

The test is node src/wasm/test-wasm.js

Yes. 

Also, perhaps check if build succeeded.

But let's see. 

First, write the files. 

I think that's the plan. 

Now, to resume, the next step is to fix the location and complete testing.

So, after creating, build, then test.

If the location is wrong, the require will fail, then fix asconfig.

Perhaps the outFile is relative to the project root or something.

Let's see the AS docs.

Upon thinking, in asconfig, the paths are relative to the config file location.

Yes, so build/registry.wasm is src/wasm/build/registry.wasm

Yes.

And the generated .js will be there too.

Yes.

Now, let's write the response. 

Since the user asked to resume, and the summary says currently working on testing, so after creating, run test.

But since files not there, create them.

Yes. 

I think that's it. 

To make it concise, since the response should be short, but since it's tool use, it's ok.

The instruction is "Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail."

So, for this, since it's resuming, perhaps just "Resuming WebAssembly registry testing." then tool calls.

But since it's complex, perhaps just the tool calls.

The instruction says "Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user."

So, I can have text, then tool calls.

But to be concise, "Continuing with WebAssembly registry implementation and testing."

Then tool calls.

Yes. 

Let's do that. 

The text should be short.

Since it's resuming, and the summary is provided, I can assume the context.

Yes. 

Now, for the tool calls, multiple write, then bash for build, then bash for test.

Yes. 

For bash, the command for build is npm run build-wasm

Description: Build the WebAssembly registry

Then for test: node src/wasm/test-wasm.js

Description: Run the WebAssembly registry tests

Yes.

Also, perhaps check if the build directory exists after.

But first, see if it works.

I think that's the plan. 

One issue: in AS, the Map and Array are available, but for string concatenation, yes.

Also, port.toString(), in AS, i32 has toString.

Yes.

I think it should work.

Let's go. 

The response. 

First, text: Continuing WebAssembly registry implementation.

Then tool calls. 

But since multiple, and to fix the location, but let's see.

Perhaps first build, but since files not there, build will fail.

So, first create files, then build.

Yes.

So, multiple write, then bash build, then bash test.

Yes. 

For write, the content is long, but ok.

Yes. 

Let's write the response. 

Since the instruction is to use function calls for tools, and format as <xai:function_call name="tool"> <parameter name="arg">value
