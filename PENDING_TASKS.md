      - [x] Broadcast events to connected WebSocket clients
      - [ ] Support MQTT integration for event publishing
      - [ ] Add event filtering by service name or event type
      - [ ] Implement event persistence for missed events
      - [ ] Add client authentication for WebSocket connections
     - [x] Implement API Gateway Integration: Built-in reverse proxy capabilities
    - [ ] Implement Configuration Management: Dynamic configuration updates for services
    - [ ] Implement Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of all registry operations

  ## Code Quality and Testing
  - [x] Run unit tests and ensure all pass
  - [x] Run load tests and verify performance targets
  - [ ] Add integration tests for WebSocket event streaming and persistence features
  - [ ] Code review and refactoring for maintainability, including error handling and code comments

   - [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for WebSocket connections and event rates

  ## Next Priority Features
  - [ ] Implement Circuit Breaker Enhancements: Add half-open state with retry logic, exponential backoff for recovery attempts, configurable failure thresholds per service, and integration with event streaming for circuit state changes
  - [ ] Implement MQTT Integration: Add MQTT client for publishing events to MQTT brokers, support for topics based on service names, and QoS levels for reliable event delivery
  - [ ] Implement Event Filtering: Add WebSocket message filtering by event type, service name, or custom criteria; support subscription-based event delivery
  - [ ] Implement Event Persistence: Store recent events in memory or database for clients to retrieve missed events on reconnection; add event replay functionality
  - [ ] Implement Client Authentication for WebSocket: Add JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections, role-based access to events, and secure event streaming
  - [ ] Implement Configuration Management: Add dynamic configuration updates for services via API endpoints, support for service-specific configs, and integration with event streaming for config change notifications
  - [ ] Implement Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of all registry operations using Winston, including user actions, system events, and security incidents; add log rotation and export capabilities
  - [ ] Implement Advanced Health Checks: Custom health check scripts for services, proactive monitoring with configurable intervals, and health status integration with load balancing decisions
  - [ ] Implement Service Dependency Mapping: Track and visualize service dependencies, detect circular dependencies, and provide dependency-aware load balancing
  - [ ] Implement Rate Limiting Enhancements: Per-service rate limiting, burst handling, and integration with circuit breakers for overload protection
  - [ ] Implement Metrics Enhancements: Detailed Prometheus metrics for WebSocket connections, event rates, circuit breaker states, and service health statistics
