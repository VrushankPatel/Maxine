# Pending Tasks for Maxine Service Registry

## Performance Optimizations
- [x] Run load tests and analyze performance metrics (target: 95th percentile < 10ms for 50 concurrent users) - ACHIEVED: ~2.04ms 95th percentile
- [x] Optimize in-memory data structures for O(1) lookups
- [x] Review and optimize heartbeat and cleanup logic
- [x] Check for memory leaks and optimize memory usage
- [x] Optimize JSON parsing and response buffers
- [x] Remove rate limiting in lightning mode for ultimate speed

 ## Missing Features Implementation
     - [x] Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs): Fine-grained permissions for service access
     - [x] Implement Service Intentions: Define allowed communication patterns between services
     - [x] Implement Service Blacklists: Prevent registration or discovery of problematic services
     - [x] Implement Persistence: Store registry state across restarts (file-based and Redis)
     - [x] Implement Federation: Connect multiple Maxine instances across datacenters
     - [x] Implement Distributed Tracing: Track service calls across the mesh (basic tracing added to Lightning Mode)
     - [x] Implement Authentication/Authorization: Secure access to registry operations (JWT auth added to Lightning Mode)
     - [x] Implement Multi-Datacenter Support: Global service discovery across multiple datacenters
     - [x] Implement Service Mesh Integration: Integration with Istio, Linkerd, etc. (Envoy and Istio config generation added)
      - [x] Implement Advanced Health Checks: Custom health check scripts and proactive monitoring
     - [x] Implement Service Versioning: Support multiple versions of the same service
    - [ ] Implement Circuit Breaker Enhancements: More sophisticated failure detection and recovery
     - [x] Implement Metrics Enhancements: Detailed performance metrics and monitoring
 ## Next Feature Implementation: Event Streaming
     - [ ] Implement WebSocket server for real-time event notifications
     - [ ] Add event types: service_registered, service_deregistered, service_heartbeat, service_unhealthy
     - [ ] Broadcast events to connected WebSocket clients
     - [ ] Support MQTT integration for event publishing
     - [ ] Add event filtering by service name or event type
     - [ ] Implement event persistence for missed events
     - [ ] Add client authentication for WebSocket connections
     - [x] Implement API Gateway Integration: Built-in reverse proxy capabilities
    - [ ] Implement Configuration Management: Dynamic configuration updates for services
    - [ ] Implement Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of all registry operations

 ## Code Quality and Testing
 - [x] Run unit tests and ensure all pass
 - [x] Run load tests and verify performance targets
 - [ ] Add integration tests for persistence and new features
 - [ ] Code review and refactoring for maintainability

 ## Documentation Updates
 - [x] Update README.md with new features
 - [x] Update API documentation in docs/
 - [ ] Update client SDK documentation

 ## Deployment and CI/CD
  - [ ] Update Docker and Helm configurations
  - [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for new features
