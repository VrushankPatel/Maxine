# Pending Tasks for Maxine Service Registry

## Performance Optimizations
- [x] Run load tests and analyze performance metrics (target: 95th percentile < 10ms for 50 concurrent users) - ACHIEVED: ~1.61ms 95th percentile
- [x] Optimize in-memory data structures for O(1) lookups
- [x] Review and optimize heartbeat and cleanup logic
- [x] Check for memory leaks and optimize memory usage
- [x] Optimize JSON parsing and response buffers

  ## Missing Features Implementation
    - [x] Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs): Fine-grained permissions for service access
    - [x] Implement Service Intentions: Define allowed communication patterns between services
    - [x] Implement Service Blacklists: Prevent registration or discovery of problematic services
    - [x] Implement Persistence: Store registry state across restarts (file-based and Redis)
    - [x] Implement Federation: Connect multiple Maxine instances across datacenters
    - [x] Implement Distributed Tracing: Track service calls across the mesh (basic tracing added to Lightning Mode)
    - [x] Implement Authentication/Authorization: Secure access to registry operations (JWT auth added to Lightning Mode)
    - [ ] Implement Multi-Datacenter Support: Global service discovery across multiple datacenters
    - [ ] Implement Service Mesh Integration: Integration with Istio, Linkerd, etc.
    - [ ] Implement Advanced Health Checks: Custom health check scripts and proactive monitoring
    - [ ] Implement Service Versioning: Support multiple versions of the same service
    - [ ] Implement Circuit Breaker Enhancements: More sophisticated failure detection and recovery
    - [ ] Implement Metrics Enhancements: Detailed performance metrics and monitoring
    - [ ] Implement Event Streaming: Real-time event notifications via WebSockets or MQTT
    - [ ] Implement API Gateway Integration: Built-in reverse proxy capabilities
    - [ ] Implement Configuration Management: Dynamic configuration updates for services
    - [ ] Implement Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of all registry operations

 ## Code Quality and Testing
 - [x] Run unit tests and ensure all pass
 - [x] Run load tests and verify performance targets
 - [ ] Add integration tests for persistence and new features
 - [ ] Code review and refactoring for maintainability

 ## Documentation Updates
 - [x] Update README.md with new features
 - [x] Update API documentation in docs/
 - [ ] Update client SDK documentation

 ## Deployment and CI/CD
 - [ ] Update Docker and Helm configurations
 - [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for new features

    ## Next Feature Implementation: Multi-Datacenter Support
    - [ ] Implement global service discovery across multiple datacenters
    - [ ] Add datacenter-aware load balancing strategies
    - [ ] Implement cross-datacenter service replication
    - [ ] Add datacenter health monitoring and failover
    - [ ] Update federation to support multi-datacenter topologies
    - [ ] Add configuration for datacenter settings (DATACENTER_ID, etc.)
    - [ ] Implement datacenter-specific service filtering
    - [ ] Add multi-datacenter tests
    - [ ] Update README.md and docs/ with multi-datacenter details
    - [ ] Ensure multi-datacenter support is optional and doesn't impact single-datacenter performance
