# Pending Tasks for Maxine Service Registry

## Recently Implemented Features
- [x] Enable GraphQL API in Lightning Mode: Added GraphQL endpoint (/graphql) to Lightning Mode for flexible service queries and mutations, matching the functionality available in Full Mode.

## Next Steps

### High Priority
- Enhance WebSocket authentication and authorization (add role-based access, token refresh)
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting for WebSocket connections (metrics for active connections, event rates)
- Implement advanced service mesh features (traffic splitting, canary deployments)
- Add multi-cluster federation with conflict resolution

### Medium Priority
- Implement Advanced Security: OAuth2 integration, fine-grained ACLs, and encrypted communication
- Implement Observability Enhancements: Distributed tracing integration with OpenTelemetry, log aggregation, and advanced monitoring dashboards
- Optimize Memory Usage: Add memory profiling and optimization for large-scale deployments with thousands of services
- Implement Kubernetes Operator: Create a custom Kubernetes operator for automated Maxine deployment and management
- Add Advanced Monitoring Dashboard: Build a web-based dashboard for real-time service registry monitoring, metrics visualization, and alerting
- Implement advanced service mesh features (traffic splitting, canary deployments)
- Add multi-cluster federation with conflict resolution
- Implement OAuth2 integration for enhanced security
- Add distributed tracing integration with OpenTelemetry

### Low Priority
- Update Client SDKs: Add new features like tags support and WebSocket client examples
- Create Comprehensive Tutorials: Guides for using event streaming, service tagging, and advanced load balancing
- Update Docker Configuration: Expose WebSocket port and handle protocol upgrades
- Update Helm Charts: Kubernetes deployment with WebSocket support
- Update CI/CD Pipelines: Include WebSocket testing and event streaming validation
- Add Monitoring and Alerting: For WebSocket connections, event rates, and service health metrics
- Update Docker configuration to expose WebSocket port
- Update Helm charts for Kubernetes with WebSocket support
- Update CI/CD pipelines to include WebSocket testing
- Create comprehensive tutorials and guides
- Optimize performance with caching layers and async processing

### Future Enhancements
#### High Priority
- Implement Kubernetes Operator: Create a custom Kubernetes operator for automated Maxine deployment and management

- Implement Service Mesh Integration Enhancements: Deep integration with Istio, Linkerd, and Envoy for advanced traffic management
- Add Distributed Tracing Enhancements: Full OpenTelemetry integration for end-to-end request tracing across services

#### Medium Priority
- Implement Multi-Region Deployment Support: Enhanced support for global deployments with geo-aware load balancing
- Add Advanced Security Features: Implement mTLS, certificate management, and fine-grained access controls
- Create Service Dependency Graph Visualization: Web UI for visualizing and managing service dependencies
- Implement Auto-Scaling Integration: Integration with Kubernetes HPA and cloud auto-scaling for dynamic service scaling

#### Low Priority
- Add GraphQL API: Provide GraphQL interface for flexible service queries and mutations
- Implement Service Catalog Integration: Integration with Open Service Broker API for enterprise service catalogs
- Add Machine Learning-Based Load Balancing: Use ML algorithms for predictive load balancing and anomaly detection
- Create Mobile SDKs: Develop SDKs for iOS and Android platforms
