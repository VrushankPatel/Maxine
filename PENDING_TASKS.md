# Pending Tasks for Maxine Service Registry

## Performance Optimizations
- [x] Run load tests and analyze performance metrics (target: 95th percentile < 10ms for 50 concurrent users) - ACHIEVED: ~1.61ms 95th percentile
- [x] Optimize in-memory data structures for O(1) lookups
- [x] Review and optimize heartbeat and cleanup logic
- [x] Check for memory leaks and optimize memory usage
- [x] Optimize JSON parsing and response buffers

  ## Missing Features Implementation
  - [x] Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs): Fine-grained permissions for service access
  - [x] Implement Service Intentions: Define allowed communication patterns between services
  - [x] Implement Service Blacklists: Prevent registration or discovery of problematic services
  - [x] Implement Persistence: Store registry state across restarts (file-based and Redis)
  - [x] Implement Federation: Connect multiple Maxine instances across datacenters
  - [ ] Implement Distributed Tracing: Track service calls across the mesh
  - [ ] Implement Authentication/Authorization: Secure access to registry operations
  - [ ] Implement Multi-Datacenter Support: Global service discovery
  - [ ] Implement Service Mesh Integration: Integration with Istio, Linkerd, etc.

 ## Code Quality and Testing
 - [x] Run unit tests and ensure all pass
 - [x] Run load tests and verify performance targets
 - [ ] Add integration tests for persistence and new features
 - [ ] Code review and refactoring for maintainability

 ## Documentation Updates
 - [x] Update README.md with new features
 - [x] Update API documentation in docs/
 - [ ] Update client SDK documentation

 ## Deployment and CI/CD
 - [ ] Update Docker and Helm configurations
 - [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for new features

  ## Next Feature Implementation: Distributed Tracing
  - [ ] Implement tracing service: Start, add events, end traces
  - [ ] Add tracing configuration options in config.js
  - [ ] Update service operations to include tracing
  - [ ] Add tracing endpoints for management
  - [ ] Integrate tracing with discovery and registration
  - [ ] Test tracing functionality
  - [ ] Update documentation for tracing
