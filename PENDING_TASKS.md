# Pending Tasks for Maxine Service Registry

## Recently Implemented Features
- [x] Enable GraphQL API in Lightning Mode: Added GraphQL endpoint (/graphql) to Lightning Mode for flexible service queries and mutations, matching the functionality available in Full Mode.
- [x] Stabilize Lightning Mode Server: Fixed server crashes under load by commenting out excessive winston logging in request handlers, preventing I/O bottlenecks. Server now handles 50 concurrent users with p95 < 2ms response time.
- [x] Enhance WebSocket authentication and authorization: Added role-based access control for WebSocket subscriptions and token refresh functionality via HTTP and WebSocket.
- [x] Add comprehensive monitoring for WebSocket connections: Added metrics for active WebSocket connections and event broadcast rates in /metrics endpoint.
- [x] Implement multi-cluster federation with conflict resolution: Added federation support in Lightning Mode for cross-datacenter service discovery and replication.
- [x] Implement advanced service mesh features (traffic splitting, canary deployments): Traffic distribution, version promotion, retirement, and gradual traffic shifting are already implemented.
- [x] Implement Service Dependencies: Added dependency management with add, remove, get dependencies/dependents, cycle detection, and graph visualization.
- [x] Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs): Added fine-grained permissions for service discovery access with allow/deny lists.
- [x] Implement Service Intentions: Added definition of allowed communication patterns between services.
- [x] Implement Multi-Region Deployment Support: Added geo-aware load balancing for global deployments, selecting closest node based on client IP location.
- [x] Optimize Memory Usage: Added heap dump endpoint for memory profiling and optimization in large-scale deployments.
- [x] Performance Optimizations: Implemented async debounced persistence saves and async WebSocket broadcasting to reduce I/O blocking and improve response times.
- [x] Advanced Monitoring Dashboard: Enhanced /dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates, interactive charts using Chart.js, improved UI with modern styling, service topology visualization, and live event streaming.
- [x] Implement Service Blacklist in Lightning Mode: Added blacklist functionality to prevent registration of unwanted services, with endpoints for add, remove, and list blacklisted services.
- [x] Optimize Discovery Latency: Implemented lightweight LRU caching layers (10k entries, 30s TTL) for frequently accessed services in Lightning Mode to reduce lookup times further.

## Next Steps

### High Priority
- Implement Kubernetes Operator: Create a custom Kubernetes operator for automated Maxine deployment and management, including CRDs for ServiceRegistry, automated scaling, and integration with K8s services. This will enable seamless integration into Kubernetes environments, allowing users to manage Maxine instances declaratively.
- Implement Service Mesh Integration Enhancements: Deep integration with Istio, Linkerd, and Envoy for advanced traffic management, including automatic sidecar injection and policy enforcement. This will provide out-of-the-box service mesh capabilities for microservices architectures.
- Add Distributed Tracing Enhancements: Full OpenTelemetry integration for end-to-end request tracing across services, with Jaeger/Zipkin support and trace correlation. Enable detailed observability for request flows through the service registry.
- Enhance Load Balancing Algorithms: Add machine learning-based load balancing that adapts to service performance metrics, failure rates, and response times for optimal traffic distribution.

### Medium Priority
- Implement Advanced Security: OAuth2 integration with providers like Google/Auth0, mTLS for encrypted communication, certificate management, and fine-grained access controls with RBAC.
- Implement Observability Enhancements: Distributed tracing integration with OpenTelemetry, centralized log aggregation with ELK stack, advanced monitoring dashboards with Grafana, and anomaly detection.
- Create Service Dependency Graph Visualization: Web UI for visualizing and managing service dependencies, with interactive graphs and cycle detection alerts.
- Implement Auto-Scaling Integration: Integration with Kubernetes HPA and cloud auto-scaling (AWS ECS, GCP, Azure) for dynamic service scaling based on load metrics.

### Low Priority
- Update Client SDKs: Add new features like tags support and WebSocket client examples
- Create Comprehensive Tutorials: Guides for using event streaming, service tagging, and advanced load balancing
- Update Docker Configuration: Expose WebSocket port and handle protocol upgrades
- Update Helm Charts: Kubernetes deployment with WebSocket support
- Update CI/CD Pipelines: Include WebSocket testing and event streaming validation
- Add Monitoring and Alerting: For WebSocket connections, event rates, and service health metrics
- Update Docker configuration to expose WebSocket port
- Update Helm charts for Kubernetes with WebSocket support
- Update CI/CD pipelines to include WebSocket testing
- Create comprehensive tutorials and guides
- Optimize performance with caching layers and async processing
